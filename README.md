Simple Rotation
===============

SimpleRotation allows you to build "macros" that can be bound to just one button and spammed or a few spread out to accommodate your particular needs.

This addon came out of the demise of the 0-castsequence macros that made it easier for people with disabilities to play. Using inspiration from GnomeSequencer I decided to build an easy to use and configurable rotation helper. One key difference is that castsequence macros inserted into the helper will remember their sequence!

Depending on your level of disability (or laziness) I recommend creating 3 buttons for various situations (single, AoE, burst) and that should cover most of your needs. Obviously keep your proc based abilities ever present on your bar to hit when one occurs.

While this addon handles my own disabilities, I am completely open to any suggestions or features that will help out people who are further inhibited. It may take me a while to get it implemented, but I'll do what I can to help as many people as possible.
